For this assignment I was given data that I needed to use to answer specific questions based on the data. I had to load the data onto PowerBi and transform it to find specific answers. Using skills from this course I had to use PowerBI to find averages, totals and determine things like the most common product purchased. I also had to structure the data according to what the questions were. I had to download PowerBi desktop to get started on the project. If the question was to find the average of the products I had to first change the data type to a decimal/integer then use the average tool to calculate the average. I learnt a new type of microsoft application which taught me how to work with different types of data.

There were a few things missing and I learnt why we need to implement them into our code. The project also helped me understand Java further.
