For this assignment I was given data that I needed to use to answer specific questions based on the data. I had to load the data onto PowerBi and transform it to find specific answers. Using skills from this course I had to use PowerBI to find averages, totals and determine things like the most common product purchased. I also had to structure the data according to what the questions were. I had to download PowerBi desktop to get started on the project. If the question was to find the average of the products I had to first change the data type to a decimal/integer then use the average tool to calculate the average. I learnt a new type of microsoft application which taught me how to work with different types of data.

### Information Systems ERD

This assignment was about creating an ERD diagram based off a case study. We had to find relevant parts of the case study to put into our ERD that went with what was being asked as well as showing the relationships between the different tables and include the primary key as well as the foreign keys. My group and I took part in meetings and discussions to understand and work on the diagram together. we involved everyones opinions and concluded which made the most sense. Our results were good based off the mark we got and I learnt how to work with so many different tables as well as understanding why certain attributes were primary keys and foreign keys.

This assignment wanted us as a group to come up with a e-commerce website of our choosing. Our task was to identify things like the problem definiton, which group member would be doing what in the task, the scope and objectives of the website as well as functionality of our program and how it will behave. We met on online calls to discuss what needed to be done and our approach to the project. We set up timelines to help monitor our progress. We finished to project and our mark wasn't the best. We could've improved in our information delivery and tried giving better feedback to eachother about our seperate given tasks.

For this project we needed to use our knowledge on Test Driven Development and Domain Driven Design in java to create a classroom system. We also had to create UML diagrams to show relationships and attributes in the system between the different classes. My task was to code the teacher domain, factory, repository and test classes using my Java knowledge. We made meetings to discuss our code and who will do what in the system. We would also help if anyone was confused on a specific part of the project. We got a good mark for our project and everything worked accordingly. There were a few things missing and I learnt why we need to implement them into our code. The project also helped me understand Java further.

For this assignment we had to research different definitions/advantages/reason based on data analytics as a group. Each of us in the group were assigned different questions we had to complete. My task was completing the questions based on different data analytics used such as descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analysis and how AI can benifit data analyst as well as how data visualisation can improve decision making. As a group we decided on who would take on which question and from there we all had to do our own research to answer the questions. Once everything was done we all read over our work to make sure everything was right. We got a very good mark for this task and I learnt the different types of analysis.
